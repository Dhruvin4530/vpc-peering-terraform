# Create VPC Peering using Terraform

VPC peering in AWS is a networking connection between two VPCs that allows you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

VPC peering is part of AWSâ€™s broader suite of networking services, providing robust options for architects and developers to create scalable, secure, and highly available network architectures in the cloud.
